I've found that my blog web site is not very mobile friendly.  There isn't much responsive design going on.

Also, the Twitter bootstrap framework seems to be the hot thing right now and I figured I might as well see what all the fuss is about.

I've updated the site (with this blog post's change) to use Twitter bootstrap as the core.  This involved a little bit of work on my end here but not too much.

The hardest part seems to be deciding on how to incorporate bootstrap.  I still dont think I have the best way to do it.

There appear to be two ways to do this: 1) Using the bootstrap nmp package. 2) Use bower which is a web dependency framework.

I've decided to just go with the npm solution for now.
