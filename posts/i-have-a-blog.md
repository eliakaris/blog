Welcome to my blog!  This is the first blog I've ever really written.  It is a place where I'll write about life, programming, and sports.

To start, I'm definitely a Windows user by nature.  But, I am writing this blog on my Mac, and more importantly, in MacOS.  I'm finding it kind of tough at times but hope that it is a good learning experience.

The blog engine I'm using is one written by my buddy [JP](http://twitter.com/jcummins).  We went to college together and he is a development manager at Twitter.  He definitely is the opposite of me in terms of the technologies he uses.  Mainly, non Microsoft tech.

Anyway, this blog engine uses node.js.  To add a blog entry, one simply creates a new [markdown file](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown) and save it in git.  I must admit, its pretty cool to have a web server in javascript.  I'm also hosting this in git, yet another new thing for me.

But I can't go completely crazy, this is hosted on [Azure web sites](http://windowsazure.com) :)

Enjoy!
